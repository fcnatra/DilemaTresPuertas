## Rules
1. Game starts with three doors closed, one winner, the others don't.
2. Player doesn't know which door is the winner.
3. Player selects a door.
4. Host, who knows where the winner door is, selects a different (not winner) door.
5. Host gives the player the option to change its original choice to the other closed door.
6. Player chooses to change or to keep its door.
7. Finally, the door selected is opened and the player wins or looses, depending on if it's the winner door.

## Dilemma
¿Are there more chances to win by keeping the first selection or by changing it when offered?
- Probabilities point to the second option.
